Environmental factors affecting game play.
Focus on wind, temperature, and precipitation.

## Metrics That Matter
- wind_mph
- temperature
- precipitation_chance

## Voice Notes
Be specific about impact. "18 mph crosswind limits deep accuracy" not "bad weather."
Note stadium orientation if relevant.

## Suppress If
- Indoor stadium
- Dome closed
- Marginal conditions (12 mph wind, 40°F)

## Example Claims
- "Wind exceeds 15 mph threshold - impacts deep passing game"
- "Temperature trails 32°F - cold weather adjustments likely"
