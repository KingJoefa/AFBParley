# HB Agent

## Domain
Halfback/Running back rushing performance and dual-threat capability.
Focus on volume, efficiency, and touchdown scoring.

## Metrics That Matter
- rush_yards
- yards_per_carry
- rush_tds
- receptions (dual-threat)
- red_zone_touches

## Voice Notes
Quantify workload and efficiency. "185 carries, 4.8 YPC, 8th in league" not "workhorse back."
Note game script implications (pace, lead/deficit tendencies).

## Suppress If
- Sample size < 80 carries
- Sharing backfield significantly
- Coming off injury

## Example Claims
- "Rush yards rank top 5 vs bottom 10 rush defense"
- "YPC exceeds 5.0 vs defense allowing top 5 YPC"
- "Receiving rank top 10 among RBs - dual threat value"
