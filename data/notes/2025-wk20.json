      "notes": "Rematch of Wild Card where Bills won 31-7. Josh Allen 'Superman game' profile with Shavers and G.Davis both out (ACL). James Cook dominated with 17/18 RB touches; Ty Johnson (ankle) unlikely. Khalil Shakir paced WRs with 71% snaps, 12 targets, 12/82/0 line. Shakir runs 60% routes in slot, avoiding Surtain. Riley Moss (CB2) led league in PBUs (19) but flagged 8x for PI, PFF 55th in passer rating allowed (93.2). Brandin Cooks emerged as top outside WR with 7/159 over last 2 games. Knox decent sleeper vs DEN TE vulnerability (9th-most yards allowed to TEs). Denver held RBs to 3.86 YPC this season but Bills defense got torched for 4.99 YPC and 8.1 YPC to JAX RBs last week. Bo Nix dual-threat (8th passing yards, 11th QB rushing). Bills injuries: Bernard (calf), Hairston (ankle), Poyer (hamstring) all questionable.",
